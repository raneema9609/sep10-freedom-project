<h1>The Topic Ive Decided on: Dentistry</h1>

<h3>Context:</h3>
<p>The topic that I decided on pursuing has been dentsitry because of the fact that I want to look into creating a website for people to be are able to acess free denist checkups in near ficilaties. This means that I want to create a something where people are able to live in a cleaner and more hygenic way for the better. Additionally, I also want to state the fact that oral hygiene can be the reason for someone's biggest reason of confidence, or their worst insecurity; which I want to help them achieve a better self-esteem. </p>

<h2>Why? & The process:</h2>
<p></p>I decided that I wanted to create a dentist hygenic webiste because I wanted something as small as oral hygeine to not just be a privlidge, but to be normalized everywhere and by doing so, kids around the world would need toothbrushes doctors, and daily habits in order to thrive. Stating this, the process would start off by developing a website, just like any other website ever created. The sources I have been looking into has been <a href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/park-ridge-family-health-center-at-nyu-langone?cid=syn_yext&y_source=1_MTU4MDkwNDgtNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D"> Free dental care,</a> and a  <a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/oral-hygiene"> a website showcasing the importance of oral health,</a> which were all started due to the great impact of knowledge for kids growing up, not knowing the basics about hygiene. Additionally, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLuaHCbtXW4">youtube video.</a> Afterwards, I was thinking about installing a location option in order to browse the user's nearby Free Family Dental care or community for free vistor availability. Furthermore, I would like to add an anonymous aproach towards the website because it can allow the person a feeling of Confidentiality and Sanctuary due to the fact that their information wont be used in any way that can be showcased to the public. This is because using a website for free help can sometimes cause a person to feel vulnerable and judged for seeking other peoples' assistance.</p>

<h2>Backup Ideas:</h2>
<p>Some backup ideas that I had in mind include creating an educational game or creating additional videos online or on youtube that allow elementary students to better understand the importance of oral health and hygiene. This can be done in several way such as talking/ communicating to the kids (online/videos) as if their "grown ups" to give them a sense of understanding that their viewed not just as a kid, but also as a smart student. These websites and videos will allow the kids easy ways of connecting with great materials that will get them to better adapt to the new things they learn at school even by showcasing to them the basics of brushing their teeth. </p>

<h2>EDP:</h2>
<p>Currently, Ive been in my engineering proccess. Thus, I have been researching and looking into several websites of which showcase REAL and time-worthy content because Im trying to solve the problem of which people arent exposed to the advacnments of technology throughout their school year. Stating this, I have also been trying to learn how to create a website by using the <a href="https://pickcode.io/"> Pickcode </a>  website after learning about it in class due to its great features that helps coding students the necessities/basics of code; Because of this, I'm hoping to connect with other programmers to create a cause to help others even in the basics of hygiene.</p>

<h2>Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Being able to Google</h3>
<p>Being able to google/ search is a major skill needed to create a good and trustworthy website because nobody wants a fualty or untrue/false webiste of which spreads misinformation to a young audience of learners. This means that being able to search for the correct resources allows for --> better research --> and therefore a better website.</p></li>

<li><h3>communication</h3>
<p>Communication is great and huge part of creating a helpful website because it allows for a clear understand on what the materials(toothbrushes, floss, etc.) will be about and how the students are able to grow with better resources around them. It also adds unto the fact that communication is needed for the safety of the users because meer-misunderstanding towards the user can sometimes lead to lawsuits due to the fact of unclear cookies/website copywrite,etc.</p></li>

<li><h3>Understanding</h3>
<p>Understanding is also a big deal when it comes to creating a website but because this is a children-hygiene-learning web, understanding is a great part. This may include fixing bugs in the code, changing up the contents shown on the website, materials showcased throughout the products provided for the students, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>For these reasons, I will continue with the research and create a website of which allows the newer generations a chance of a brighter and more hygenic future. This can become possible with the help of other teachers, programmers,friends, and notice from others for the upcoming years.</p>
