<h1>The Topic Ive Decided on: Social Work/Education</h1>

<h3>Context:</h3>
<p>The topic that I decided on pursuing has been Social Work becuase of the fact that I want to look into creating a website of which people are able to acess free books worldwide for free. This means that I want to create a something where people are able to look into their nearest library's and access educational books for free. </p>

<h2>Why? & The process:</h2>
<p></p>I decided that i wanted to create an educational website because I wanted something as an education to not just be a privlidge, but to be normalized everywhere and by doing so, kids around the world would need books in order to thrive and learn. Stating this, the process would start off by developing a website, just like any other website ever created. The sources I have been looking into has been <a href="https://mmwelches.crsd.org/teachers/gradesspecialists/second-grade/mrs-remmey/free-reading-websites"> Free reading websites,</a> and a  <a href="https://atinternetmodules.org/storage/ocali-ims-sites/ocali-ims-atim/documents/OnlineBookResources.pdf"> PDF</a> which were all started due to the importance of knowledge for kids as shown in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW2r5uStgG0">youtube video.</a> Afterwards, I was thinking about installing a location option in order to browse the user's nearby Public Libraries or community reading exchanges available. Furthermore, I would like to add an anonymous aproach towards the website because it can allow the person a feeling of Confidentiality and Sanctuary due to the fact that their information wont be used in any way that can be showcased to the public. This is because using a website for free help can sometimes cause a person to feel vulnerable and judged for seeking other peoples' assistance.</p>

<h2>Backup Ideas:</h2>
<p>Some backup ideas that I had in mind include creating an educational game or creating additional videos online or on youtibe that allow elementary students to better understand the cirruculum or teachers better. This can be done in several way such as talking/ communicating to the kids (online/videos) as if their "grown ups" to give them a sense of understanding that their viewed not just as a kid, but also as a smart student. These websites and videos will allow the kids easy ways of connecting with great materials that will get them to better adapt to the new things they learn at school. </p>

<h2>EDP:</h2>
<p>Currently, Ive been in my engineering proccess. Thus, I have been researching and looking into several websites of which showcase REAL and time-worthy content because Im trying to solve the problem of which people arent exposed to the advacnments of technology throughout their school year. Stating this, I have also been trying to learn how to create a website by using the <a href="https://pickcode.io/"> Pickcode </a>  website after learning about it in class due to its great features that helps coding students the necessities/basics of code; Because of this, I'm hoping to connect with other programmers to create a cause to help others.</p>

<h2>Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Being able to Google</h3>
<p>Being able to google/ search is a major skill needed to create a good and trustworthy website because nobody wants a fualty or untrue/false webiste of which spreads misinformation to a young audience of learners. This means that being able to search for the correct resources allows for --> better research --> and a better website.</p></li>

<li><h3>communication</h3>
<p>Communication is great and huge part of creating a helpful website because it allows for a clear understand on what the materials will talk about and how the students are able to grow with better resoucres arounf them. It also adds unto the fact that communication is needed for the safety of the users because meer-misunderstanding towards the user can sometimes lead to lawsuits due to the fact of unclear cookies/website copywrite,etc.</p></li>

<li><h3>Understanding</h3>
<p>Understanding is also a big deal when it comes to creating a website but because this is a children-learning web, understanding is a great part. This may include fixing bugs in tghe code, changing up the contents shown on the wbsite, materials showcased throughout the books provided for the readers, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>For these reasons, I will continue with the research and create a website of which allows the newer generations a chance of a brighter and more diverse future. This can become possible with the help of other teahcers, programmers,friends, and notice from others for the upcoming years.</p>
