<p>Since my last blog entry, I've been learning more about oral hygiene and its tools in helping others. During my research I looked into the several websites of which make everyday teeth-cleaning (brushing teeth, flossing, etc.) a little easier. For example, I came across a 
<a href="https://penguinhealth.ca/saliva-ejector-a-medical-wonder/">Saliva Ejector.</a> I learned that a saliva ejector is a small tube that removes saliva and extra fluids from your mouth during dental work, it helps keeps your mouth dry, so that the dentist is able to work better and more comfortably. This means that it's used in many dental treatments to keep the area clean and dry, making procedures easier and more effective.</p>

<p>Additionally, I also came across a <a href= "https://sloancreekdental.com/what-is-an-ultrasonic-scaler-and-its-benefits/">Ultrasonic Scaler.</a> A Ultrasonic Scaler helps dentists by using high-frequency vibrations to clean plaque and tartar from teeth quickly and gently, allowing the patient and the doctor a quicker and easier way to carry out an annoying and uncomfertable task for a better hygenic smile. Stating this, a scaler also helps prevent gum disease of which keeps the teeth healthy. Dentists use it for regular cleaning, deep cleaning, and to remove stubborn tartar inside the gums.</p>

<p>I also learned about something called a <a href="https://www.aae.org/specialty/clinical-resources/cone-beam-computed-tomography/">Cone Beam Computed Tomography. (also known as"CBCT")</a> A CBCT helps dentists by creating 3D images of your teeth and jaws, allowing dentists to clearly see inside your mouth. This helps to diagnose problems and plan-out future personalized treatments better for the patient to better cover personal issues. Dentists use the CBCT for things like accurate diagnosis, root canal treatments, and complex dental surgeries.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also looked into a <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/image-editor">Dental Monitoring App.</a> This app allows dentists to check how your orthodontic treatments are going remotely. Through this app, You are able to take pictures of your teeth at home, and forward it directly to your dentist, allowing them to see your teeth, without you having to visit the office often, or even at all. (only if needed for possible changes) This app is also used for regular check-ups during braces or aligner treatments, saving time on both ends, and making sure everything is on track through your dental journey.</p>

# How I came Across This:
<p>The way that I was able to find this information was because of easy searches through the HSTAT Library Resources anf Google. Stating this, it took me awhole to get reasonable resources since at first, I was getting unrelated links and documents not connecting with they key words I used for my research. After several searches, I looked up words like "helpful dentistry wesbites", "dentistry", and even "tools that professional dentists use" in order to achieve more sufficient and detailed responses back.</p>

# EDP:
<p>During the engineering process, I'm currently still in the researching design process. This means that I've looked into many websites and apps that relate to dentistry, which exposed me to many useful details about the many tools that dentists use in their field. This allowed me to gather several information in order to better understand the information of which the tools are being used for and how they work, leading to the possibility of me incorprating them into my website. My next step will be to look through my current research and information in order to start planning how I'm going to be creating my project of which will be focused on how technology is used in dentistry.</p>

# Skills:
<h2>Researching</h2>
<li>As stated in Blog 1, the habit of being a good researcher means to be a good "Googl(er); this means to be able to search for the correct resources allowing for --> better research --> and therefore a better website. Not doing so can lead to several mistakes within the website, therefore making it unrelaible. </li>
<h2>Understanding</h2>
<li>Understanding is also a big deal when it comes to creating a website because of the fact that this is going to be a dentistry based website, understanding the field and tools is an important part. This may include fixing bugs in the code, changing up the contents shown on the website, and the resources given to the students,etc.</li>

# Next Steps:
<p>The text steps of my website will be to extend my research and knowledge about the latest tools of dentistry and the impacts that technology poses in the field. I also want to look through the production of the tools used and how they help dentists preform better with the help of technological tools, avoiding complications of which might happen without the advancements of the technology in tools. </p>
